# AutoPanas Backend API v3

This is the backend API for the AutoPanas project. 
It is written in TypeScript and uses the [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) framework.
Also, it uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) as a JavaScript runtime.

## Getting Started

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.19. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
